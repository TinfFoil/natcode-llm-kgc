<s>[INST] You are an AI specialized in the task of extracting entity-relation-entity triples from texts.

Look at the examples below and then carry out the following indicated task.

Example 1:
text: "The proposed scheme eliminates redundant copying while maintaining the quasi-destructive scheme 's ability to avoid over copying and early copying combined with its ability to handle cyclic structures without algorithmic additions ."
The candidate relations for this text are:
Used_for
Feature_of
Conjunction
The candidate entities for this text are:
scheme
cyclic structures
quasi-destructive scheme 's ability
scheme
over copying
early copying

triple_list: [["scheme", "Used_for", "cyclic structures"], ["quasi-destructive scheme 's ability", "Feature_of", "scheme"], ["over copying", "Conjunction", "early copying"]]

Example 2:
text: "The operations are reduced to functions of a formal language , thus changing the level of abstraction of the operations to be performed on SI-Nets ."
The candidate relations for this text are:
Used_for
The candidate entities for this text are:
operations
SI-Nets

triple_list: [["operations", "Used_for", "SI-Nets"]]

Example 3:
text: "We describe two experiments : one which ignored word-sense distinctions , resulting in 6.3 % accuracy for semantic classification of verbs based on ( Levin , 1993 ) ; and one which exploited word-sense distinctions , resulting in 97.9 % accuracy ."
The candidate relations for this text are:
Evaluate_for
The candidate entities for this text are:
accuracy
semantic classification

triple_list: [["accuracy", "Evaluate_for", "semantic classification"]]


Task: Extract a list of [entity, relation, entity] triples from the text below. Do not produce any more text samples after you finish extracting triples from the text below.
text: "The agreement in question involves number in nouns and reflexive pronouns and is syntactic rather than semantic in nature because grammatical number in English , like grammatical gender in languages such as French , is partly arbitrary ."
The candidate relations for this text are:
Conjunction
Feature_of
Hyponym_of
The candidate entities for this text are:
nouns
reflexive pronouns
grammatical gender
languages
French
languages

[/INST] triple_list: [["nouns", "Conjunction", "reflexive pronouns"], ["grammatical gender", "Feature_of", "languages"], ["French", "Hyponym_of", "languages"]]</s></s>
